Followup chest\n examination after treatment is recommended in approximately two weeks. Findings: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright\n position.  Available for comparison is a preceding chest examination dated\n ___.  \n \n As before, there is moderate cardiomegaly with a configuration indicative of\n left ventricular enlargement.  Thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated\n and shows calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch. \n There is, however, no evidence of local aortic contour abnormalities.  The\n pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is now a parenchymal infiltrate\n on the right lung base and the lateral view confirms this finding in the form\n of some hazy parenchymal densities and a peripheral plate atelectasis in the\n right lower lobe posterior segment.  No other acute abnormalities are seen;\n however, the lung bases have a generally hyperinflated appearance suggestive\n of COPD.\n \n When comparison is made with the preceding chest examination obtained ___\n years ago, the moderate cardiac enlargement existed already at that time. \n There existed also a few for pneumonia suspicious infiltrates on the right\n base, but they have changed their appearance to some degree."
